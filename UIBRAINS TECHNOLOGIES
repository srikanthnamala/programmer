                <h3>HTML</h3>
                <p>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. 
                    It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.
                </p>
                <p>Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. 
                    HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.</p>

                <h3>CSS</h3>
                <p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document
                    written in a markup language such as HTML.
                    CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript</p>
                    <p>CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and fonts.
                        This separation can improve content accessibility, provide more flexibility and control in the specification of 
                        presentation characteristics, enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate 
                        css file which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content as well as enabling the css file to be cached 
                        to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting</p>

            <article>
                <h3>JAVASCRIPT</h3>
                <p>JavaScript often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification. 
                    JavaScript is high-level, often just-in-time compiled, and multi-paradigm. It has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, 
                    prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions.</p>
                    <p>Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web.
                        JavaScript enables interactive web pages and is an essential part of web applications. 
                        The vast majority of websites use it for client-side page behavior and all major web browsers have a dedicated 
                        JavaScript engine to execute it.

                <article>
                    <h3>ANGULAR JS</h3>
                    <p>The AngularJS framework works by first reading the Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) page, 
                        which has an additional custom HTML attributes embedded into it. Angular interprets those
                         attributes as directives to bind input or output parts of the page to a model that is represented by 
                         standard JavaScript variables. The values of those JavaScript variables can be manually set within the code, 
                         or retrieved from static or dynamic JSON resources</p>
                         <p>AngularJS is built on the belief that declarative programming should be used to create user interfaces and 
                             connect software components, while imperative programming is better suited to defining an application's business logic.
                             The framework adapts and extends traditional HTML to present dynamic content through two-way data-binding that allows for 
                             the automatic synchronization of models and views. As a result, AngularJS de-emphasizes explicit Document Object Model (DOM) 
                             manipulation with the goal of improving testability and performance.

            <article>
                <h3>JQUERY</h3>
                <p>jQuery is a JavaScript library designed to simplify HTML DOM tree traversal and manipulation, as well as event handling, 
                    CSS animation, and Ajax.[3] It is free, open-source software using the permissive MIT License. 
                    As of May 2019, jQuery is used by 73% of the 10 million most popular websites.
                    Web analysis</p>
                    <p>jQuery's syntax is designed to make it easier to navigate a document, select DOM elements, create animations, handle events, 
                        and develop Ajax applications. jQuery also provides capabilities for developers to create plug-ins on top of the JavaScript library. 
                        This enables developers to create abstractions for low-level interaction and animation, advanced effects and high-level, themeable widgets. 
                        The modular approach to the jQuery library allows the creation of powerful dynamic web pages and Web applications</p>

            <summary>AJAX</summary>
            <article>
                <h3>AJAX</h3>
                <p>Ajax is a set of web development techniques using many web technologies on the client side to create asynchronous w
                    eb applications. With Ajax, web applications can send and retrieve data from a server asynchronously (in the background) 
                    without interfering with the display and behaviour of the existing page. By decoupling the data interchange layer from the
                     presentation layer, Ajax allows web pages and, by extension, web applications, to change content dynamically without 
                     the need to reload the entire page.In practice, modern implementations commonly utilize JSON instead of XML.</p>
                     <p>Ajax is not a single technology, but rather a group of technologies. HTML and CSS can be used in combination 
                         to mark up and style information. The webpage can then be modified by JavaScript to dynamically display—and 
                         allow the user to interact with—the new information. The built-in XMLHttpRequest object, 
                         or since 2017 the new "fetch()" function within JavaScript, is commonly used to execute Ajax on webpages, 
                         allowing websites to load content onto the screen without refreshing the page. Ajax is not a new technology, 
                         or different language, just existing technologies used in new ways</p>

                <h3>BOOTSTRAP</h3>
                <p>Bootstrap, originally named Twitter Blueprint, was developed by Mark Otto and Jacob Thornton at Twitter as a framework
                     to encourage consistency across internal tools. Before Bootstrap, various libraries were used for interface development, 
                     which led to inconsistencies and a high maintenance burden</p>
                     <p>According to Twitter developer Mark Otto:
                        A super small group of developers and I got together to design and build a new internal tool and saw 
                        an opportunity to do something more. Through that process, we saw ourselves build something much more
                         substantial than another internal tool. Months later, we ended up with an early version of Bootstrap as a way to 
                         document and share common design patterns and assets within the company.

            <article>
                <h3>TYPESCRIPT</h3>
                <p>ypeScript is a programming language developed and maintained by Microsoft. 
                    It is a strict syntactical superset of JavaScript and adds optional static typing to the language. 
                    TypeScript is designed for development of large applications and transcompiles to JavaScript. 
                    As TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript, existing JavaScript programs are also valid TypeScript programs.</p>
                    <p>TypeScript may be used to develop JavaScript applications for both client-side and server-side execution 
                     There are multiple options available for transcompilation. Either the default TypeScript Checker can be used,
                     or the Babel compiler can be invoked to convert TypeScript to JavaScript.
